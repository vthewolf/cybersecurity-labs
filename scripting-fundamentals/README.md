# Linux Fundamentals — Bash scripting (basic)

**Platform:** TryHackMe / local notes  
**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Duration:** ~1–2 hours

## Objective
Learn basic Bash scripting to automate simple Linux tasks: variables, input, loops, conditionals, execution permissions.

## Files created
- `first_script.sh` — interactive greeting (read + echo)
- `loop_script.sh` — `for` loop example
- `conditional_script.sh` — basic if/else flow
- `bank_access.sh` — combined loop + conditional authentication prototype

## Files created
- Importance of shebang and execution permission (chmod +x).
- Using read for input and if/else + for loops for control flow.
- Useful combination: find + grep for fast searches.

## Key commands
```bash
chmod +x first_script.sh
./first_script.sh
find / -name "flag.txt" 2>/dev/null  
```
