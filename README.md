# Cybersecurity Labs Portfolio

This repository contains practical labs and exercises I have completed as part of my learning journey in cybersecurity.  

## Completed Labs

#### Bash scripting (basic)
- **Platform:** TryHackMe
- **Date:** 2025-10-07
- **Duration:** ~1â€“2 hours
- **Objective:** Learn basic Bash scripting to automate repetitive Linux tasks and practice shell fundamentals (variables, conditionals, loops, I/O).
- **Summary:** Created several small scripts:
  - `first_script.sh`: interactive script that reads user input and prints a welcome message.
  - `loop_script.sh`: basic `for` loop that iterates a sequence of numbers.
  - `conditional_script.sh`: demonstrates `if/else` checks based on user input.
  - `bank_access.sh`: small practice script combining loops and conditionals to validate username/company/PIN.
- **Key commands used:** `nano`, `chmod +x`, `./script.sh`, `read`, `for`, `if/else`, `echo`, `find`, `grep`.
- **Evidence:** `linux-fundamentals/screenshots/console_result.png` (final console output).
- **Notes / Lessons learned:**
  - Basics of Bash syntax and structure (shebang, executable permission).
  - How to read user input, control flow with loops and conditionals.
  - Practical pattern: combine `read` + checks for simple automation and prototype scripts.

### Future Labs
- **Wireshark / TCPdump**: network traffic capture and analysis
- **Nmap**: port scanning and enumeration
- **Metasploit**: exploitation exercises
- **Burp Suite**: web app vulnerability testing
- **Hydra / Gobuster**: password attacks and brute-force testing
- **Cryptography**: basic encryption/decryption exercises
